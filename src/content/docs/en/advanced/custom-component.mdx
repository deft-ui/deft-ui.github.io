Deft includes some commonly used basic components and allows you to create custom components to meet complex requirements.

_Note: Custom components here refer to basic components like Label and Button. If you need to create custom React/Vue/Solid components, you should refer to the custom component tutorials for the respective frameworks; this tutorial does not apply._

### Creating a Custom Component

Creating a custom component is very simpleâ€”you only need to implement the `ElementBackend` trait.

The `ElementBackend` trait has several methods, but only the `create` method is mandatory. Other methods can be implemented optionally based on requirements.

First, we need to create a struct to represent our custom component. Here, we use `HelloBackend` as an example.

```rust
pub struct HelloBackend {
    element_weak: ElementWeak,
}

impl ElementBackend for HelloBackend {
    fn create(element: &mut Element) -> Self where Self: Sized {
        Self {
            // Save a weak reference to the element, which will be used later
            element_weak: element.as_weak(),
        }
    }
}
```

### Registering the Custom Component

After creating the custom component, it needs to be registered. This can be done during the initialization of the JS engine.

```rust
impl IApp for AppImpl {
    
    fn init_js_engine(&mut self, _js_engine: &mut JsEngine) {
        // Register our custom component with the tag "hello"
        register_component::<HelloBackend>("hello");
    }
    ...
}
```

Here, we register this component as the `hello` component.

### Creating JS Binding for the Custom Component

To use this custom component in JS, we need to create a JS binding: `HelloElement` .

```javascript
class HelloElement extends Element {
    constructor() {
        // "hello" is the element's tag, which must match the tag declared during registration
        super("hello");
    }
}
```

`HelloElement` inherits from the `Element` class, which is the base class for all components.

### Using the Custom Component

After completing the three steps of `creation`, `registration`, and `binding`, the component can be directly used in JS code.

First, define some basic styles for it.

```css
body {
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
hello {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background: #ccc;
}
```

Then, instantiate a `hello` component and add it to the document flow.

```javascript
const helloElement = new HelloElement();
window.body.addChild(helloElement);
```

The running effect is as follows:

<Image src={initImg} alt="hello element" width="300" />

### Rendering the Component

As shown, our custom component is displayed in the window, but it doesn't do anything yet. Now, let's enhance this component by adding custom rendering logic, which is typically required for custom components.

To add custom rendering logic, implement the `ElementBackend::render` method.

```rust
impl ElementBackend for HelloBackend {
    ...
    fn render(&mut self) -> RenderFn {
        // Upgrade the weak reference to the element to a strong reference
        let element = self.element_weak.upgrade_mut().unwrap();
        // Get the element's size information
        let bounds = element.get_bounds();
        // Get the center coordinates of the element
        let center = (bounds.width / 2.0, bounds.height / 2.0);
        // Calculate the radius
        let radius = f32::min(center.0, center.1);
        RenderFn::new(move |painter| {
            let mut paint = Paint::default();
            // Use fill style
            paint.set_style(PaintStyle::Fill);
            paint.set_color(Color::from_rgb(0, 80, 0));
            // Draw a circle
            painter.canvas.draw_circle(center, radius, &paint);
        })
    }
}
```

The `render` method returns a `RenderFn` object containing our component's rendering logic. In the example above, we draw a solid circle. Rerun the application to see the final effect:

<Image src={renderImg} alt="custom element with renderer"  width="300" />
